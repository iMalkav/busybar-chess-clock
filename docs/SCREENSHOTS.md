The device framebuffer was read through `/api/screen` and encoded as PNG. No
image generation, resizing or retouching was used for the source PNGs.
The app was installed and launched for capture, then quit; the original settings
were restored. Comprehensive device testing and testing on the latest release
firmware remain separate release checks.
